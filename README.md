Follow Focus Gear - LOMO Prime Lens
=============

A follow focus gear for LOMO prime lenses designed to replace the original 0.5mm pitch gears with gears that are cinema standard 0.8mm.

I never liked the fact that the original LOMO gears have such a thin contact area, so this new design increases that to a full 10mm.

There are a few variations in the way these lenses are built, so I have included 3 screw and 4 screw versions of the design, as well as a version that has clearance for the bayonet mount. Using this design in theory should let you install the focus ring without having to remove the lens mount, assuming the original focus ring can be removed in the same way.

If removing your lens mount is required for installation and you are not comfortable doing so, take your lens to a professional for installation.
