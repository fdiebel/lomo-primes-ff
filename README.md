Follow Focus Gears for Lomo Prime Lenses
=============

A follow focus gear for LOMO prime lenses designed to replace the original 0.5mm pitch gears with gears that are cinema standard 0.8mm.

I never liked the fact that the original LOMO gears have such a thin contact area, so this new design increases that to a full 10mm.

NOTE: You must remove the lens mount to install this gear. If you are not comfortable doing so, then don't! I'll be adding a second version of this gear that will not need the lens mount to be removed.

Instructions
--------
* Some stuff about print setup.
* Maybe some more stuff.
* Yep, a little more stuff.
